# Project Title: Safe Travel Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project leverages predictive modeling and an interactive dashboard to identify safe travel destinations for underrepresented groups, earning the crowd favorite award for its innovation. It uses a combination of Python libraries and Tableau Public to analyze and visualize safety indices derived from the Social Progress Index and Legatum Prosperity Index datasets.

## Tools Used
* **Python:** For data manipulation and predictive modeling using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Used for interactive code execution and documenting the analysis process.
* **Tableau Public:** For crafting interactive visualizations and the final dashboard.
* **Canva:** Used for designing the Datafolio and final presentation materials.

## Installation
To run the Python notebooks locally, you will need to install the required Python libraries. Hereâ€™s how you can set up your environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/lrbonsu/safe-travel-dashboard.git
cd safe-trip-recommender
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
* SQL Server (or any other relational database management system that supports SQL)
* Any SQL client (e.g., DBeaver, SQL Server Management Studio)
* Download and install Synthea for generating synthetic patient data

## Interactive Dashboard
Access the interactive dashboard developed in Tableau Public through this link: [Safe Trip Recommender]([https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lynnetta.bonsu/viz/C1Project2022/CapstoneProjectRevisionStory]). 

## Data Sources
* **Social Progress Index (SPI)**
* **Legatum Prosperity Index (LPI)**

Details about the datasets and their preprocessing are included within the Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Structure
* `/notebooks`-Contains the Jupyter notebooks detailing the data analysis and modeling steps.
* `/data`-Directory containing the processed datasets used in the project.
* `/docs`-Documentation and Datafolio materials designed in Canva.
* `requirements.txt`-Required Python libraries for the project.
